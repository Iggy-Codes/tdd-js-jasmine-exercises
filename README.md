## Synopsis

Write a program to determine if the the parentheses (),
the brackets [], and the braces {}, in a string are balanced.

For example:

{{)(}} is not balanced because ) comes before (

({)} is not balanced because ) is not balanced between {}
     and similarly the { is not balanced between ()

[({})] is balanced

{}([]) is balanced

{()}[[{}]] is balanced

From Balanced Parentheses in [Cyber Dojo](http://cyber-dojo.org/setup_default_start_point/show_exercises/?language=Javascript&test=jasmine)

## Motivation

Practice to code following the test-driven development (tdd) process
Exercises done during the MEAN Stack [Skylabcoders Academy](http://www.skylabcoders.com/) bootcamp.
